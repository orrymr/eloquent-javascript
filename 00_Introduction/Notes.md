# Javascript and the Web Browser

Javascript build into every modern browser. \
JavaScript was introduced in 1995 as a way to add programs to web pages in the Netscape Navigator browser. \
It has made modern web applications possibleâ€”that is, applications with which you can interact directly without doing a page reload for every action \
\
After Javascript started getting used outside of Netscape, there needed to be a way to define how Javascript worked across all different browsers: ECMA Script.\
There have been several version of Javascript.
- ECMA Script 3 during Javascript's ascent to dominance: 2000-2010
- ECMA Script 4 was ultimately a big ambitious change and ultimately abandoned in 2008
- ECMA Script 5, less ambitious came out in 2009
- ECMA Script 6, 2015.
- Since then, small updates every year.

# Web Browsers are not the only bits of software that support Javascript

## Some DBs support
- MongoDB
- CouchDB

use JS as their query and scripting language

## Platforms for server and desktop programming

Such as Node.js (but there are others).
